# Term Project for Advanced Java
This is my term project which consits of a simple phone database created in Java fx.

## Motivation for this project

The Motivation for this project was to explore different techniques that were learned during the second part of the summer term in class. Some of these techniques were are also researched and found outside the course material for a deeper understanding of Java fx capabilites. The final purpose of this project was to challenge me to create a new project from scratch.

## Prerequisites

### Built With

* [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) - Language used.
* [Eclipse](www.eclipse.org) - Software used.

### Libraries Required
This project was perform in Java, with the use of Java fx libraries for graphical interface. Also, Apache Derby was used in this project in order to handle Database querries and store data. [Apache Derby can be downloaded here](https://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html). Remeber to add it to your classpath.
This libraries can be obtained by downloading the following JARs and adding them to the project's library resources.

Also as an extra step, the next lines must be introduced in the VM section of the run preferences:

--module-path "\path\to\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib"


--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml


### Visualizations
These are some visualizations of the phonebook database. They are stored in containers since the image size is too large and it looks messy
